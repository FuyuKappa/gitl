# gitl (Genshin Impact Team List)
This is a website built with react for users to create and catalogue their Genshin teams.
I made this because I like to experiment with teams and use as many characters I can. However, Genshin Impact only has 15 team slots which I have all filled up.

This site will use local storage to store the data of your teams, and will support data import and export using a data file in order to facilitate transfer of data, as we don't have access to a database.
