# Gacha game team list
This is a website built with react for users to create and catalogue their gacha game teams.
I made this because I like to experiment with teams and use as many characters I can. However, Genshin Impact only has 15 team slots which I have all filled up.
This was originally supposed to only be for Genshin Impact, but I realized I wanted to catalogue the teams I made in other games I play, like ZZZ and Wuthering Waves.

Luckily, the components are reusable for each game, as they should be, so I'm working on expanding the site.
The games I currently plan to support is:
- Genshin Impact
- Zenless Zone Zero
- Azur Lane
- Wuthering Waves

This site uses local storage to store the data of your teams, and will support data import and export using a data file in order to facilitate transfer of data, as we don't have access to a database.
Adding support for another game isn't the hardest, but it will take a lot of time for games with a lot of characters.
